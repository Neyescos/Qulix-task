I've done this half of the task in about an hour, but I've faced some problems on my way to do second layer of the project(BLL),system couldnt parse direct link to DAL of the project in BLL so I couldnt continue making mapper profile and services. I've tried some possible ways to resolve this problem such as: recreating project, renaming projects and namespaces, but nothing could help the problem.
